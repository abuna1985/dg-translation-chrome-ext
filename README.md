# Deepgram Translation Chrome Extension

A repository for creating a chrome extension that allows users to create transcripts and to translate transcripts.
This is a JavaScript project that uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

This project was inspired by [@phazonoverload](https://github.com/phazonoverload)'s [Chrome Transcription blog post](https://blog.deepgram.com/transcribing-browser-tab-audio-chrome-extensions/).
